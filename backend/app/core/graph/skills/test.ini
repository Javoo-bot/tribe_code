# Create an Agent that Stores Information and Creates Templates

## Objective
Develop an agent that merges client data with templates to generate the final legal document and delivers it.

## Implementation Steps

### Template Storage

  - [x] Store templates in formats like `.txt` or `.docx` or `.json` 
  - [x] Define a clear placeholder Syntax
  - [x] Create a mock Define a clear placeholder Syntax
  - [x] Upload the files to the project to test them in local

### Agent Functionality

  - [x] Read file from  the localpath
  - [x] Read the client information file
  - [x] Use `re` library to find all the markers 
  - [x] Replace all the markers in a new file called 'schema'
  - [x] Create a new file

### LLM Entity Extraction

  - [] Define system prompts to instruct the LLM

     - [x] Define Clear data scheme with pydantic
     - [x] Create a data extraction function
     - [x] Create a Tool
     - [x] Configure Azure on Langchain
     - [x] Start agents with tools
     - [x] Process the input file 
     - [x] Generate the output file

  - [x] Use LLM responses to fill in the predefined categories 
      - [x] Validate the output
         - [x] Implement `AgentOutputParser`
         - [x] Difference between agent and LLM
         - [x] Deprecated libraries 
      - [x] Check expected input & output format: structured_tools
      - [x] Integracion con Azure AI
      - [x] Integrate Agent in langchain and Azure workflow 
      - [x] Resolver debug using Langraph
      - [x] Even though we are using a Deprecated method it works better
      - [x] Ensure data format matches pydantic.
      - [x] Document discrepancies and analyze failure patterns.

  - [] Create a second agent   
      - [x]  Load the template
      - [x]  Load the result from the previous agent
      - [x]  Load script with both results
      - [x]  Generate prompt with instructions to create a new txt document
      - [x]  Send the prompts to the LLM
           - [x] Debugging dictionary loading 
           - [x] More context LLM for substitution
      - [x]  Generate desire output
      - []  Attempting CI/CD / pytest/ unitest

### 3. Create a Substitution Script

Develop a script that performs the following tasks:
- Reads the template file.
- Loads the data from the data source.
- Processes the template by replacing placeholders with the corresponding data.
- Generates the final output file with the substituted information.

### 4. Configure VS Code Tasks

Set up custom tasks in VS Code to run your substitution script seamlessly. This involves:
- Creating a `tasks.json` file within the `.vscode` directory of your project.
- Defining the task configuration to execute your script.



### Data Insertion

  - [] Replace placeholders in the template using the extracted data 
  - [] Ensure all placeholders are correctly replaced 
  - [] Perform validation checks to confirm all fields are filled in.

### Document Generation

- [ ] Combine the template with the inserted client data to create a complete legal document.
- [ ] Save the final document in the required format (e.g., `.pdf`, `.docx`).
- [ ] Use a library like `pdfkit` or `WeasyPrint` for generating PDFs, if necessary.
#### Example Libraries:
- **Python**: `string.Template`, `Jinja2`

### Simplifications
- **No Database**: Templates are stored locally, so no database is needed.
- **Version Control**: Use manual version control (e.g., file backups) during initial development.
